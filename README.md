## API Usage
Your MapmyIndia Maps SDK usage needs a set of license keys ([get them here](http://www.mapmyindia.com/api/signup) ) and is governed by the API [terms and conditions](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/terms-&-conditions). 
As part of the terms and conditions, you cannot remove or hide the MapmyIndia logo and copyright information in your project. 
Please see [branding guidelines](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/API-Branding-Guidelines.pdf) on MapmyIndia [website](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api) for more details.
The allowed SDK hits are described on the plans page. Note that your usage is
shared between platforms, so the API hits you make from a web application, Android app or an iOS app all add up to your allowed daily limit.
